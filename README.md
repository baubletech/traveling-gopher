# Traveling Gopher

## About

This project is dedicated to our attempts to optimize classic graph traversal algorithm which can be used to solve traveling merchant problem.

Project is separated in 2 parts for now: main file and `segment` package (used to describe and generate chain *segments* used in algorithm).

## Run

Use `go run cmd/main.go` to run program with built-in Golang interpreter.  
Use `go build cmd/main.go` to compile executable.
